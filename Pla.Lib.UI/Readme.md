# PLA LIB UI 

PlaLibUI is a very simple lightweight graphical user interface. The idea behind it is to allow simple rendering of any form without a big pain. Use of this GUI should come hand in hand with any systems that is fully cross platform.

Currently has a few simple widgets:
* Frame
* Label
* Button
* Editor
